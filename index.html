            <p>I was born on January 19th 1992 in the city of Asuncion, Paraguay under 2 Korean parents but my culture is a mix of both Paraguayan and Korean.
            I moved to the United States in 2001 with my family and lived in Georgia ever since. I attended college in Georgia State University for 2 years as a Computer Science major.
